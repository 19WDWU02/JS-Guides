                <h2>Console and Alert</h2>
                <p>
                    Both the console.log() and the alert() function are developer tools to help us with our website development.<br>
                    Console.log(); will log a message into your browsers console. You can do this with any dataType which we will and have be using.<br>
                    Look at script.js line 1 for an example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Alert displays an alert box with a message which we specify. You can only view a string dataType inside of an alert.<br>
                    alert(); will pause all the javascript and won't continue until the user clicks the ok button.<br>
                    Look at script.js line 3 for an example.

                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    A JS variable are containers for a dataTypes value. They can hold any data Type value which can then be reused later on in the script.<br>
                    When you first use a js variable, you are to declare it by using saying var, followed by the the variable name.<br>
                    There are a few rules when creating a JS variable.<br>
                    They
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot contain Spaces</li>
                    <li>They cannot just be a number</li>
                    <li>Must either begin with a letter, underscore or dollar sign</li>
                    <li>Variables are case-sensitive</li>
                    <li>There is a list of words you cannot be used - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp" target="_blank">Reserved Words</a></li>
                    <li>Ideally your nameing should describe whatever variable is holding</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Look at script.js line 5 for variable examples</p>
